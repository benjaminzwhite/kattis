"""
Reading comprehension question with unclear testcase: it's straightforward BFS but in the inputs section it says that:

"Note that some authors list a limited set of his/her coauthors; but two people are considered coauthors if either lists the other as a coauthor"

So basically if e.g. bob: [frank,alice], then it may be that bob IS ALSO COAUTHOR WITH jimmy BUT IT IS NOT LISTED IN bob:
You have to wait until jimmy: details appear, then check if jimmy: [karl, bob] <-- and in this example, we see that bob is here
