TODO: IMPROVE: my binary search implementation isn't very good I think; need to improve how I handle
these kind of exercises where there are floats (to avoid numerical issues etc.).

Also based on problem statement I don't think there should be a ZeroDivisionError exception, so maybe
can rewrite to avoid division by small values.

It's mainly reading comprehension to understand what is being asked and handle various cases.

    # Note that while Sheilaâ€™s speedometer might have negative readings, her true speed was greater than zero for each segment of the journey.
    # -> I take this to mean that in the inputs, if you have a speedometer speed of -145 then the constant c must be at least +145
    # otherwise s+c would be < 0 which is UNPHYSICAL.
    # Similarly if you have a speedometer speed of +23 then the constant c must be at least -23 since otherwise s+c would be < 0 also
    # => SO YOU TAKE THE NEGATIVE OF THE SMALLEST "speedometer" SPEEDS TO HANDLE BOTH CASES.

# if smallest speedometer speed is +23  then c is at least -23

# Binary search implementation comment:
# the epsilon approach didn't work for me, gets TLE:
# have to do "number of RUNS" binary search (Halim CP4 book talks about this, to avoid precisely this TLE possibility/numerical issues)
